# Svelto.ECS.Examples.Cache

New Parallelism Example is explained here: http://www.sebaslab.com/svelto-ecs-svelto-tasks-new-example-plus-whats-coming-and-optimization-related-thoughts/ the article complements the comments in the code.

You can add Svelto-ECS framework from the original repository or syncing it from this one using the submodule approach. 

This project shows how to use **EntityStructs** but I will hope to add better examples soon.

**Note: The folders Svelto.ECS, Svelto.Tasks and Svelto.Common, where present, are submodules pointing to the relative repositories. If you find them empty, you need to initialize the submodules through the submodule command. You must initialize only the first level submodules, so do not run the recursive option. I am sorry if this is confusing, but it's the best solution I found with git. If you have troubles, please check some instructions here: https://github.com/sebas77/Svelto.ECS.Vanilla.Example/wiki**
